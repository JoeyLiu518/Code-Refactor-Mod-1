1.	In line 7 on the HTML file, I added “Horiseon” in between <Title> tag.
2.	h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n</h1>
In line 12 on the HTML file I removed the <span> tag because this did not have any purpose as the color of Horiseon was all white.
3.	Remove <Div> tag in line 13 and 25 and replace with <nav> in HTML file.

For 3 and 4 you replace the <Div> tag with <nav> tag because this is the navigation part of the website.

6.	Replaced <Div> tag with <Main> tag in line 28 and 49 because this is the main content of the website. HTML
7.	Remove class=”content” because each of the image source has a class= already. After doing this go to the CSS file and remove line 72 to 76 because you do not need this after removing the class=content in HTML.
